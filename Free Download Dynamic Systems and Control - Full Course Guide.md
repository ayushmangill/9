## What Are Dynamic Systems and Control?

**Dynamic systems** are systems whose state evolves over time. Think of a thermostat controlling the temperature of a room, a cruise control system in a car, or even the population of a species in an ecosystem. Their behavior is governed by differential equations that describe how the system changes in response to inputs and disturbances.

**Control systems** are designed to influence the behavior of dynamic systems. The goal is to make the system behave in a desired way, such as maintaining a constant temperature, following a specific trajectory, or stabilizing an unstable system. Control engineers use various techniques to design and implement these systems. This field is incredibly important in various industries.
