## Why Learn Derivatives and Integrals?

Calculus, the study of continuous change, relies heavily on derivatives and integrals. **Derivatives** allow us to determine the instantaneous rate of change of a function, essentially its slope at any given point. This is crucial for optimization problems, finding maximums and minimums, and understanding how things change over time. Imagine optimizing a website's loading speed, predicting the trajectory of a rocket, or calculating the most efficient route for a delivery truck â€“ all require a solid understanding of derivatives.

**Integrals**, on the other hand, deal with accumulating quantities. They allow us to calculate areas under curves, volumes of solids, and solve differential equations. Think about determining the total distance traveled by a car based on its velocity function, calculating the amount of water flowing through a pipe, or modeling the population growth of a species â€“ these applications are all powered by integrals.

Without a grasp of these core concepts, youâ€™ll find yourself at a significant disadvantage in many STEM-related fields.

## What You'll Learn in the "Derivadas e Integrales Desde Cero" Course
